Find Location and Dispatch to the Nearest Tow Company by GPS location 

Often times people are broke down somewhere in the world and all they have
is their smartphone and have no idea where they are at. This website and
code will attempt to help them get service as soon as possible and notify
reputable tow companies where someone has broken down.

Connecting with Twilio and calling the nearest tow company as well as 
two way information exchange is part of this project. 

My background is automating tow companies with a legacy app called FoxTow
and over 350 installs throughout the U.S.
